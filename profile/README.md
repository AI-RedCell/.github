## 🚀 Before We Begin: Crawl → Walk → Run  
Jailbreaking isn’t step one.  
Before you break the system, you need to **understand the system**.

At AI RedCell, we follow a structured path:

### **1. Crawl – Learn the Basics**
- What is AI?  
- How do LLMs work?  
- What is a prompt?  
- Why does prompting matter?

### **2. Walk – Understand Safety**
- Why do models refuse certain answers?  
- What are guardrails?  
- How does alignment work?  
- What is red teaming?

### **3. Run – Begin Jailbreaking**
- Jailbreak styles  
- Prompt injections  
- Payload crafting  
- Bypassing filters ethically

Our **first foundational course** (now in this repo) covers:
> **AI Fundamentals + Prompt Engineering Basics**  
Your true starting point before touching real jailbreaks.
